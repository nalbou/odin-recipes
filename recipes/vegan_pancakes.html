<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>gold brown, easy to make, with oil instead of milk, best served with some syrup and fruits</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons white sugar</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1 ¼ cups water</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon oil</p>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <p>1. Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center. Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Pour oil and water into flour mixture.</p>
        <p>3. Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.</p>
        <p>4. Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</p>
        <p>5. Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
        <p>6. Serve with berries.</p>
    </ol>

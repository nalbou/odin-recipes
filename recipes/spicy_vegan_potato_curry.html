<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This vegan potato curry has abundant spices that make this better than any restaurant curry I've tasted.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 yellow onion, diced</p>
        <p>3 cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>4 teaspoons curry powder</p>
        <p>4 teaspoons garam masala</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons ground cumin</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons salt</p>
        <p>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</p>
        <p>1 Â½ teaspoons cayenne pepper</p>
        <p>1 (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained</p>
        <p>1 (15 ounce) can peas, drained</p>
        <p>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</p>
        <p>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</p>
    </ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <p>1. Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with curry powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, ginger, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes more.</p>
        <p>3. Add cooked potatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and tomatoes, then pour in coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking for 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
    </ol>
